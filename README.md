# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
Please find the starting process of first rough draft of my Portfolio.
I understand that we will build and make improvements on the Portfolio as we continue to progress in this course.

## Installation
I reviewed and used as reference the previous class activities as well as going back to the zoom class for reinforecement when working on the
challenge. It was fun, challenging, and many times frustrating building an HTML and CSS file from scratch. I could see how my HTML was coming to 
life and using Chrome Developer Tools to see what was missing or where I can improve was a big help. 

## Credits

I used Chrome Developer Tools to troubleshoot as I was working to complete my HW.

I used w3schools to find examples of how I was approaching my HTML and CSS and how to deploy.
