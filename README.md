# My First Portfolio

Please find my Portfolio assignment.

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.
An effective portfolio highlights my work as well as the thought processes behind it. Portfolios with deployed web applications
(meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.

This last point can’t be stressed enough: at many companies, having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you'll use during your job search.
